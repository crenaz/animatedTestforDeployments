An html doc with basic animation just to test deployments.

Yeah, so Heroku is pretty much dead.  They are getting rid of the free tier which makes it unusable to me because I'm not an enterprise. 

Right now, I'm looking at these platforms:

 - CloudFlare Pages
 - Netlify
 - Render.com
 - Vercel

P. S. I forgot to mention: fly.io, they're also pretty cool.
